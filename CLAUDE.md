# Swift-TUI

A SwiftUI implementation for the terminal. We are trying to match the SwiftUI API 1:1

# Programming Practices
- Commit at the smallest unit of work you did. I am giving you explicit permission to commit.
- DO NOT SWITCH BRANCHES UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED BY THE USER
- Don't use a scripts directory
- Use .scratch dir for scratch work
- No emojis!
- Never make tests pass by hardcoding pathways for them

# Goal
Based on the feature parity document, implement remaining APIs for both macOS and Linux and keep the feature parity document in sync. We are implementing SwiftUI in the terminal!
