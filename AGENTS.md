# Swift-TUI

A SwiftUI implementation for the terminal. We are trying to match the SwiftUI API 1:1

# Programming Practices
- Commit at the smallest unit of work you did. I am giving you explicit permission to commit.
- DO NOT SWITCH BRANCHES UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED BY THE USER
- Don't use a scripts directory
- Use .scratch dir for scratch work
- No emojis!
- Never make tests pass by hardcoding pathways for them

# Goal
Based on the feature parity document, implement remaining APIs for macOS and keep the feature parity document in sync. We are implementing SwiftUI in the terminal! We haven't completed our goal until every API in the feature parity document has been implemented properly. We are also very focussed on making this the prettiest and the most useful and most helpful TUI for everyone!
